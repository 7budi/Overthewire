This one a the same as before but when I saw the recommended commands I may need i saw the grep and thought that it is a must.
while tring to find it with grep(i knew i couldn't find it using it since I need to know what's in the file)  got a lot of errors and stuff after a while i went back to the "find" command and used the same command as the previous one.
 find / -type f -user username -group groupname -exec ls -al {} \\;
