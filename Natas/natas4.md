How does the site know where I'm visiting it from?
1) IP address
2) Cookies
3) HTTP headers
4) Browser Settings
Look into HTTP GET requests
Found that there is a referrer to some other link and then found a base16 code.
after a while a found out that i can change the get header if natas4 to 5 to get the answer.
