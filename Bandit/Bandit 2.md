This one was pretty easy just had to put comma b/c if we just cat a file with space the cat command will think its a different because of the space.

example: "spaces in this file" if we tried it without comma it will go and try to search for a file called "spaces" and then "in" and then "this" and "file", but if we insert the comma it will read it like one and print it.
