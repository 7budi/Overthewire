The Internet is a many routers that is owned by many ISP's(Internet Service Provider).
When we decide to speck on the other side of the internet,
we are putting data on the wire which is going to be handed from router to router owned by different isp's all the way across the internet until it arrives to the other side. 
As soon as we put the data on the wire we no longer have any control over the data.
The most common data transferred on the internet is website.
A webist is written in HTML and transferred with HTTP(which is not secure).

When a website data is transferred using HTTP it is transferred as it is(Usernames and password and other personal information will be seen) and anyone in between we see it or have access to it.

This is what SSL and TLS trying to solve.What SSL/TLS do is crate a secure,protected tunnel across the internet.

That's where HTTPS come from, an HTML is transferred with HTTP protected by SSL.

SSL/TLS can also protect other data transfer:
1. SSL VPN

SSL(Secure Socket layer) is an example of hybrid cryptography which basically means it's a method of using symmetric and asymmetric cryptography to send secure communications.
TLS(Transport Layer Secure) is the sequel of ssl.
SSl and TLS follow the same process
